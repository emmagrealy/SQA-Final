# Introduction

This assignment is based around the use of gitflow and testing. 
My main objective for this assignment is to create a software component that stores information about surveys and their responses.

There will be no user interface or connection to external storage.It will only contain a "Controller" class with methods that will 
support the various features. The only way to determine if the code is successful is through a test suite created using JUnit.
By following a Test-Driven development approach when creating my project and will aim for each commit to contain both tests and the 
appropriate code to match.

This assignment must contain the following: 
* A scrum sprint backlog with the estimations of the tasks I will complete
* Test Driven Development (TDD) detailed section and how I created my project with this approach.
* A code coverage tool section detailing the tool I will use and why I selected this tool.
* My pull review checklist detailing all my checks that a reviewer other than myself would make when making pull requests.
